      <description>About Code Craft is a group that has been running for over ten years to provide a friendly regular meeting for technical folk in Dunedin, New Zealand.
Weâ€™re a real friendly bunch, and will do everything we can to help you fit in. The tech industry is growing hard around Dunedin, and Code Craft is simply one of those places where we can socialise outside of eotk, and feel happy talking to like minded people.</description>
