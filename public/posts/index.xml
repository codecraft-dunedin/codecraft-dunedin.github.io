      <description>Hi everyone
We had a great first meeting on the 2nd of February and for me personally it was great to get back to a meeting in person!
So a big thanks to Kit, Ina and Nick for speaking.
Kit spoke about his experience trying to update a large Angular JS web application to React whilst not impacting service &amp;lsquo;too much&amp;rsquo; using Single SPA (https://single-spa.js.org/). Maybe not for every project but the discussion showed a few of the group using this technology for various purposes.</description>

      <description>Tools and techniques for debugging embedded systems are like anything else: a compromise between competing goals. Historically, they have been some combination of proprietary (usually expensive) and hacky, and generally lag behind those for regular computers. Debuggers are usually relatively slow, which can mean they aren&amp;rsquo;t usable for debugging in the real-time environments that embedded systems are often used in; rather than a debug_printf(&amp;quot;got here\n&amp;quot;);, it might only be practical to insert a turn_on_led(); in a suspect piece of code.</description>

      <description>Hey there,
This is our first blog post, but we’re sure more posts and/or articles will come more often as we are only just getting started with a better web presence.
We hope to be able to either post videos of the talks online (with captions), any slideshow presentstion or simple tutorials for people to follow and learn.
Lastly, you will be able to see when the next Code Craft talk is, if you would like to come and listen.</description>
