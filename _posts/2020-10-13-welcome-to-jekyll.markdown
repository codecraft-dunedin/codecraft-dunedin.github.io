Hey there,

In the general idea of having more people have access and ability to contribute, we have started a github repo that uses Jekyll and github pages to provide a website.

Email tim@penhey.net or rachel@penhey.net if you want to help and we can add you to the repo.

Leaving this stuff here so I can find it later...

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
