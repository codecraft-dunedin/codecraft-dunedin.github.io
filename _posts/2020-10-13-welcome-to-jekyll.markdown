Hey there,

This is our first blog post, but we're sure more blog posts will come more often.

We hope to be able to either post videos of the talks online (with captions), any slideshow presentstion or simple tutorials for people to follow and learn.

Lastly, you will be able to see when the next Code Craft talk is, if you would like to come and listen. We don't bite, we want to make it a welcoming and inclusive space for all.

We welcome people of all ages and interests in all aspects software and hardware development.

Cheers.
