# codecraft-dunedin.github.io

This is the beginning of our README. There's not much here right now, but things are coming soon. If you'd like to help, go for it.

A few of us chat in the #dunedin channel on the DevelopNZ Slack - you're welcome to join via https://dev.elop.nz/

We're really welcome to any ideas from the community, please don't be afraid of contributing or creating issues. If you don't think it's enough for an issue, then let us know via email or on Slack.

If you want to contribute but you're not quite sure how, let us know and we'll be more than happy to lend a mentoring hand. We do have the [Contributing](https://codecraft.org.nz/contributors/) guide - so you can always pull down the website and give it a try.

To keep up to date with everything that is happening, please join our Google Group/Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/g/codecraft-dunedin or you can join our Meetup Group: https://www.meetup.com/Code-Craft-Dunedin/

As always, be excellent to each other.
