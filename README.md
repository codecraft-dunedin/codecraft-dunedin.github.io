# codecraft-dunedin.github.io

This is the beginning of our README. There's not much here right now, but things are coming soon. If you'd like to help, go for it.

You can find us in real-time on IRC - Freenode in #dunedintech.

If you're a Slack person, you can join DevelopNZ (https://developnz.herokuapp.com) and message me (veb) if you have any questions. 

We've also created a Discord server for Code Craft Dunedin. You can join here: https://discord.gg/BCvFYsQ

We're really welcome to any ideas from the community, please don't be afraid of contributing or creating issues. If you don't think it's enough for an issue, then either join IRC, Slack or Discord and chat with some of us.

If you want to contribute but you're not quite sure how, let us know and we'll be more than happy to lend a mentoring hand.

To keep up to date with everything that is happening, please join our Google Group/Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/g/codecraft-dunedin

As always, be excellent to each other.
