This is the beginning of our README. There's not much here right now, but things are coming soon. If you'd like to help, go for it.

You can find us in real-time on IRC - Freenode in #dunedintech.

If you're a Slack person, you can join DevelopNZ (https://developnz.herokuapp.com) and message me (veb) if you have any questions. 

We've also created a Discord server for Code Craft Dunedin. You can join here: https://discord.gg/BCvFYsQ

We're really welcome to any ideas from the community, please post those in the issues. If you don't think it's enough for an issue, then either join IRC, Slack or Discord.

As always, be excellent to each other.
