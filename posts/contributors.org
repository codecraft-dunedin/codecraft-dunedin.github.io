*** How to Contribute to this site

-  Pull from Github (using SSH),
   =git@github.com:codecraft-dunedin/codecraft-dunedin.github.io.git= -
   you may use other options like [[https://desktop.github.com/][Github Desktop]] etc.
-  Once you have the Code Craft website on your local computer protected
   by git, you can make a new branch for your changes:
   =git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]= you can read some more
   about that at [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout][Atlassian]].
-  Don't be afraid to hack your branch as much as you want to, it's your
   branch after all.
-  As we are running Hugo, you'll need to
   [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/][follow their tutorial]] on setting it up on your machine.
-  When all that is done, you'll be able to run this project with
   =hugo server -D= By default (at least for me), it's started on port
   =1313= - but once you enter the serve command, it'll tell you the
   link to the site.
-  Once you're ready to make your changes live, you'll need to push your
   branch (See the above link to Atlassian for any other enquiries).
-  You will need to create a PR (pull request) for your pushed branch
   which
   [[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request][you can find information about on Github itself]]
-  We will review it as soon as we can and either confirm it immediately
   or have some sort of discussion around it first.
