## How to Contribute to this site {#how-to-contribute-to-this-site}

-   Pull from Github (using SSH),
    `git@github.com:codecraft-dunedin/codecraft-dunedin.github.io.git` -
    you may use other options like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) etc.
-   Once you have the Code Craft website on your local computer protected
    by git, you can make a new branch for your changes:
    `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]` you can read some more
    about that at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout).
-   Don't be afraid to hack your branch as much as you want to, it's your
    branch after all.
-   As we are running Hugo, you'll need to
    [follow their tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) on setting it up on your machine. I do suggest going
    through the entire tutorial but if you seemingly know your way around
    these things but you do not know Jekyll, there is the
    [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) option.
-   When all that is done, you'll be able to run this project with
    `jekyll serve` By default (at least for me), it's started on port
    `4000` - but once you enter the serve command, it'll tell you the
    link to the site.
-   Once you're ready to make your changes live, you'll need to push your
    branch (See the above link to Atlassian for any other enquiries).
-   You will need to create a PR (pull request) for your pushed branch
    which
    [you can find information about on Github itself](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
-   We will review it as soon as we can and either confirm it immediately
    or have some sort of discussion around it first.
